We installed Lazy Vim from its official repository. We used the default Lazy Vim configuration. To add configurations, it's important to follow the official documentation and add code to the .config/nvim/lua/config/options.lua file as directed.

An essential part is to activate Lazy Vim extras with the :LazyExtras command and install the necessary plugins.

For example, for the Rust plugin, opening a Rust file and running :LazyExtras makes installing plugins easier, as Lazy Vim itself recommends the appropriate plugins.

For the theme, we created a ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua file. This file contains all the information needed to download and apply themes.

The ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/noice.lua file disables the noice plugin, which is responsible for displaying a floating message with the command when entering execution mode. When disabled, it will appear on a line at the bottom of the console, just like in vim.

The ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/snack-explorer.lua file adds the configuration to show hidden folders and files.

The ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/go-lang.lua file contains the configuration for working with Go. This configuration was extracted from the official repository. This file can be viewed and/or downloaded at the following link: https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/lua/lazyvim/plugins/extras/lang/go.lua. It is important to mention that there are more configuration files. The configuration in those files is the same as documented and is the default configuration for Lazy Vim's extras plugins (reference to the :LazyExtras command).
